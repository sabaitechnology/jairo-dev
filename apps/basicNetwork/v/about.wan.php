	<div class='controlBoxContent'>
	
		<p class='smallText'> JaiRo is an open source routing project created with the goal becoming the most powerful unified networking platform in the world. Similar in concept to the transition from basic cell phones to smart phones, we are moving routers from a closed source, embedded platform, to an open-source fluid computing platform. The software is created to run on 64-bit x86 hardware and is modular. Installable mods provide endless flexibility and extensibility - driven by you, the developer.</p>
		
		<p class='smallText'>JaiRo is an amazing router platform and is special for several reasons:</p>
		
		<ul class='smallText'>			
			<li> First, it is a platform, not just a hardware unit. The software will be released under an open source license and based on Ubuntu Linux Server, meaning it will work on many different x86 (64-bit computer grade) hardware structures.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li> Secondly, JaiRo is modular. The open source community will have the opportunity to develop networking modules for phone servers, IP camera streaming, media servers, and more on a platform that will actually support that functionality at the heart of the network. The extensibility opportunity is amazing and until now, the platform just hasn&#39;t existed. Finally, JaiRo brings a level of usability to networking that has never existed before. Projects like setting up a file server are daunting for many users, so they just don&#39;t use the technology. JaiRo is a platform which allows a packaged solution to be installed with one click, just like you would an app on your smartphone. JaiRo has the ability to put power and understanding at the users fingertips. It allows them to relate to the interface in a way that is intuitive.
